Even though everyone is measured with the same lung function test, each site can differ in ways that influence lung function, (e.g., differences in equipment calibration, technician training, recruitment patterns, environmental pollution, healthcare access…)\nNone of these are measured in our dataset, yet all of them can systematically impact the mean FEV1/FVC ratio at a site. This means that participants from the same site are more similar to each other than to participants from a different site (no independent observations).\nIf we ignore this clustering and use ordinary regression, those unmeasured site-level factors can impact our estimates of the fixed effects such as smoking or exposure category.\nA random intercept for site takes in those differences by allowing each site to have its own baseline level of lung function.\n\nOther resources\n\nMixed models in epidemiology\nMixed models in psychology\nMixed models in ecology\nMixed models in finance"

    "text": "Brief description\nMixed models, also known multilevel/hierarchical models, are a type of statistical model that include fixed effects and/or random effects. Traditional linear models assume all observations are independent, but that’s rarely true. For example, patients from the same hospital, students from the same classroom, or multiple measurements from the same individual, have a specific structure that if ignored, it can lead to biased estimates, underestimated variability, and invalid conclusions. In this project, I plan to offer a practical introduction to mixed effects models in R, focusing on their use for analysing data with grouped/hierarchical structures. I will cover when and why to use mixed models, explain the difference between fixed and random effects, and walk through examples using specific R packages"

The dirty dataset (mixed_dirty.txt) mirrors the kind of inconsistencies found in real epidemiological studies, including: typos, missing entries, odd units, and empty spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nid\nUnique participant identifier (1–2000)\n\n\nsite\nStudy site (country: UK, USA, Colombia, India, South Africa, Poland, Vietnam, or Australia)\n\n\nage\nParticipant age in years (contains missing values)\n\n\nsex\nRecorded sex (e.g., “M”, “F”, “male”, “Female”, “f”, “m”, “other”)\n\n\nheight_cm\nHeight in centimetres (may include blanks, “NA”, or blank spaces)\n\n\nweight_kg\nWeight in kilograms (some missing or inconsistent entries)\n\n\nBMI\nBody mass index derived from height and weight; includes rounding errors and missing values\n\n\nsmoking_status\nSelf-reported smoking behaviour with inconsistent text (e.g., “Never”, “never”, “CURRENT”, “ex”, “quit&gt;1y”, “Unknown”)\n\n\npack_years\nApproximate pack-years of smoking exposure (some missing or inconsistent with smoking status)\n\n\neducation\nEducational attainment (free-text responses such as “primary”, “sec”, “College”, “uni”, or blanks)\n\n\njob\nReported occupation, intentionally messy (e.g., “nuse”, “mining”, “constructor”, “teacher”, “office”)\n\n\nexposure_cat\nOccupational exposure category (“low” or “high_exposure”) with inconsistent naming\n\n\nFEV1_mL\nForced Expiratory Volume in 1 second, in millilitres; includes outliers, missing values, and some negative entries\n\n\nFVC_mL\nForced Vital Capacity, in millilitres; includes missing values\n\n\n\n\nNote: The mixed_dirty.txt dataset includes deliberate inconsistencies and data quality issues for you to identify and correct during cleaning exercises (e.g., converting FEV1/FVC to litres, standardise categorical variables, and deriving exposure categories).\n\nYour task is to explore, clean, and prepare it for analysis."

Fixing white spaces and NAs\nIt is common to encounter missing spaces in our data, but it is important to ensure that this is fixed before we start analysing our data. The str_squish() function trims these and replaces multiple spaces with a single one, this is an important first step before matching or grouping text variables (e.g., “nurse” vs “nurse”).\n\ncleaning &lt;- dirty %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~str_squish(.x)))\n\n\n\n2. Convert numeric columns correctly\nSometimes numbers are stored as text (for example, “170” or “NA” as a string). We need to make sure we convert those variables to numeric format.\n\ncleaning &lt;- cleaning %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(c(age, height_cm, weight_kg, BMI, pack_years, FEV1_mL, FVC_mL),\n                ~suppressWarnings(as.numeric(.x))))\n\n\n\n3. Standardise categorical variables\nCategorical variables often contain many variations of the same label (e.g., “female”, “FEMALE”, or “F”). Here, we make them consistent using case_when(). The same logic applies to similar variables such as smoking status and education. Standardising is a very important step that ensures data is grouped correctly.\n\ncleaning &lt;- cleaning %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    sex_clean = case_when(\n      str_starts(tolower(sex), \"m\") ~ \"Male\",\n      str_starts(tolower(sex), \"f\") ~ \"Female\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n    ),\n    smoking_status_clean = case_when(\n      is.na(smoking_status) | smoking_status %in% c(\"\", \"NA\", \"Unknown\", \"unknown\") ~ NA_character_,\n      str_starts(tolower(smoking_status), \"never\") ~ \"Never\",\n      str_detect(tolower(smoking_status), \"current|smokes socially\") & \n        !str_detect(tolower(smoking_status), \"quit\") ~ \"Current\",\n      str_detect(tolower(smoking_status), \"former|ex|quit\") ~ \"Former\",\n      tolower(smoking_status) == \"occasional\" ~ \"Current\",\n      TRUE ~ NA_character_\n    ),\n    education_clean = case_when(\n      is.na(education) | education %in% c(\"\", \"NA\", \"na\", \"none\", \"None\") ~ \"None\",\n      tolower(education) %in% c(\"primary\") ~ \"Primary\",\n      tolower(education) %in% c(\"secondary\",\"sec\",\"high school\") ~ \"Secondary\",\n      tolower(education) %in% c(\"college\",\"uni\",\"tertiary\",\"masters\",\"phd\",\"bsc\") ~ \"Tertiary\",\n      TRUE ~ \"None\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n4. Clean job names (for this ReCoDe example)\nIn epidemiology studies, we often collect self-reported data like occupational data for our research questions. But coding job titles can be messy, (if not using standardised tools) resulting in misspellings (“nuse”), inconsistent forms (“mining” vs “miner”), or abbreviations. By converting everything to lowercase first and then mapping known variants to standard labels, we make sure occupations are consistent and ready to categorise later (e.g., into exposure groups).\n\ncleaning &lt;- cleaning %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    job_lc = tolower(job),\n    job_clean = case_when(\n      job_lc %in% c(\"nuse\",\"nurse\") ~ \"nurse\",\n      job_lc %in% c(\"miner\",\"mining\") ~ \"miner\",\n      job_lc %in% c(\"constructor\",\"construction\") ~ \"construction worker\",\n      job_lc == \"office\" ~ \"office worker\",\n      job_lc == \"teacher\" ~ \"teacher\",\n      job_lc == \"farmer\" ~ \"farmer\",\n      job_lc == \"driver\" ~ \"driver\",\n      job_lc == \"welder\" ~ \"welder\",\n      job_lc == \"factory\" ~ \"factory worker\",\n      job_lc == \"carpenter\" ~ \"carpenter\",\n      job_lc == \"doctor\" ~ \"doctor\",\n      job_lc == \"security\" ~ \"security\",\n      job_lc == \"cleaner\" ~ \"cleaner\",\n      job_lc == \"mechanic\" ~ \"mechanic\",\n      job_lc == \"electrician\" ~ \"electrician\",\n      job_lc == \"bartender\" ~ \"bartender\",\n      job_lc == \"porter\" ~ \"porter\",\n      TRUE ~ job_lc\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n5. Create a new variable\nIt is very common to derive and create new variables when using large datasets. In this example, we classify jobs into high exposure or low exposure categories based on potential for dust, fumes, or other respiratory hazards. This step prepares the dataset for later regression or mixed-model analyses exploring exposure–lung function relationships.\n\ncleaning &lt;- cleaning %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    exposure_cat_clean = case_when(\n      job_clean %in% c(\"miner\",\"welder\",\"factory worker\",\"carpenter\",\"mechanic\",\"electrician\") ~ \"high_exposure\",\n      job_clean %in% c(\"office worker\",\"teacher\",\"doctor\",\"nurse\",\"construction worker\", \"security\",\"cleaner\",\"bartender\",\"porter\",\"farmer\",\"driver\") ~ \"low_exposure\",\n      TRUE ~ \"low_exposure\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n6. Convert FEV1 and FVC to litres and calculate ratio\nFEV1 and FVC are recorded in millilitres in the raw data, so we convert them to litres for analysis. The FEV1/FVC ratio is a key lung function indicator and values below normal suggest obstruction. During collection of this data some errors may have occurred, so it is important we remove any outliers at this stage that could bias our analyses later on.\n\ncleaning &lt;- cleaning %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    FEV1_L = FEV1_mL / 1000,\n    FVC_L  = FVC_mL / 1000,\n    FEV1_FVC = FEV1_L / FVC_L\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    FEV1_L = if_else(!is.na(FEV1_L) & FEV1_L &lt;= 0, NA_real_, FEV1_L),\n    FVC_L  = if_else(!is.na(FVC_L) & FVC_L &lt;= 0, NA_real_, FVC_L),\n    FEV1_FVC = if_else(!is.na(FEV1_FVC) & (FEV1_FVC &lt;= 0 | FEV1_FVC &gt; 1.2), NA_real_, FEV1_FVC)\n  )\n\n\n\n7. Convert FEV1 and FVC to litres and calculate ratio\nThis step applies the NHANES 2014 Hansen reference equations to estimate the Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) for FEV1/FVC, expressed in percent. For each participant:\n\nMales use 74.5 − 0.12 × age\nFemales use 80.2 − 0.214 × age\n\nWe then compare their observed FEV1/FVC ratio (converted to a percentage) against this LLN. The new variable Below_LLN is coded as following:\n\n1= airway obstruction\n0= no airway obstruction\n\nThis binary flag is useful for logistic regression or for summarising the prevalence of obstruction across exposure or demographic groups. We will also use it when running different mixed-models changing the outcome variables.\n\ncleaning &lt;- cleaning %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    lln_pct_male = 74.5 - 0.12 * age,\n    lln_pct_fem  = 80.2 - 0.214 * age,\n    lln_pct = case_when(\n      sex_clean == \"Male\"   ~ lln_pct_male,\n      sex_clean == \"Female\" ~ lln_pct_fem,\n      TRUE ~ ((74.5 - 0.12 * age) + (80.2 - 0.214 * age)) / 2  # fallback if sex not M/F\n    ),\n    # Convert ratio to percent for comparison, then flag below LLN\n    Below_LLN = as.integer(!is.na(FEV1_FVC) & (FEV1_FVC * 100) &lt; lln_pct)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(-lln_pct_male, -lln_pct_fem)\n\n\n\n✨ Clean Data: Ready for Analysis\nOnce cleaned, the dataset becomes mixed_clean.txt, with harmonised categories, derived lung function metrics, and an approximate lower limit of normal (LLN) for FEV1/FVC.
