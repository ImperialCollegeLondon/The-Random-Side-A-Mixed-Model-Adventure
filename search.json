    "text": "Brief description\nMixed models, also known multilevel/hierarchical models, are a type of statistical model that include fixed effects and/or random effects. Traditional linear models assume all observations are independent, but that’s rarely true. For example, patients from the same hospital, students from the same classroom, or multiple measurements from the same individual, have a specific structure that if ignored, it can lead to biased estimates, underestimated variability, and invalid conclusions. In this project, I plan to offer a practical introduction to mixed effects models in R, focusing on their use for analysing data with grouped/hierarchical structures. I will cover when and why to use mixed models, explain the difference between fixed and random effects, and walk through examples using specific R packages"

    "text": "Target Audience 🎯\nThe primary focus is to work with large (usually epidemiological) data. Mixed models are useful when working with repeated measures, nested data, or simply when we want to account for variability across groups.\nThese models however, can be applicable to any large dataset (any discipline), that has sufficient grouping or hierarchical structure, ensuring accurate interpretation and conclusions."
